<h1>What's up? I'm Julian! 👋</h1>

✶I'm a Software Engineer with a successful background in music production and audio engineering.✶

My diverse background of disciplines helps me creatively tackle problems as I'm used to shifting perspectives & skillsets to get the job done.

I'm experienced in object-oriented full stack development (Ruby On Rails, JavaScript, React) and integrating natural language processing/machine learning APIs. As is required in the fast-moving world of tech, I'm highly skilled at learning complex technologies in a short period of time.
    
<h2>👻GhostWriter v2.0👻</h2>

[Demo](https://ghostwriterv2-front-end.herokuapp.com/songs?fbclid=IwAR3aTschedisg7_s3NyH2-s9ET8fEJ2Hu6N_nvAa8HqEeo2ENoR-DJFU83U) | [Front-End Repo](https://github.com/julianxlozano/GhostWriter-v2.0-frontend)

This app uses OpenAI's GTP-3 to generate rhyming song lyrics based on the users input "inspiration" word.
I was fortunate enough to get access to the beta of OpenAI's GTP-3, and started developing this app straight away. The latest iteration uses React/Redux on the front end, and Ruby on Rails for the back end. I've also deployed a text-to-speech feature to bring the generated text to life.



*My chief aim in everything I do is to use technology, words, and art to make people's lives easier and to beautify the world.*

*Let's get it!*
