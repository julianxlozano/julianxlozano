###What's up? I'm Julian! ðŸ‘‹

âœ¶I'm a Software Engineer with a successful background in music production and audio engineering.âœ¶

I have years of experience working for creative agencies on tight deadlines and helping companies achieve their creative/technical goals. I've worked with brands such as:

  âœ¶SHEIN
  âœ¶DSW 
  âœ¶Bliss Cosmetics
  âœ¶and more... 

 My work has been featured on:

  ðŸŒŸForbes
  ðŸŒŸABC

  ðŸŒŸPaste Magazine


My diverse background of disciplines helps me creatively tackle problems as I'm used to shifting perspectives & skillsets to get the job done.

I'm experienced in object-oriented full stack development (Ruby On Rails, JavaScript, React) and integrating natural language processing/machine learning APIs. As is required in the fast-moving world of tech, I'm highly skilled at learning complex technologies in a short period of time.

My chief aim in life is to use technology, words, and art to make people's lives easier and to beautify the world.

Let's get it!
