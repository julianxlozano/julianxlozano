<h1>Hi Everyone! I'm Julian! 👋</h1>

✶I'm a Software Engineer with a successful background in music production and audio engineering.✶

My diverse background of disciplines helps me creatively tackle problems as I'm used to shifting perspectives & skillsets to get the job done.

I'm experienced in object-oriented full stack development (Ruby On Rails, JavaScript, React, React Native) and integrating natural language processing/machine learning APIs. As is required in the fast-moving world of tech, I'm highly skilled at learning complex technologies in a short period of time.
